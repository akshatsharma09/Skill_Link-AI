# TODO List for Project Updates

## Add Relevant Images
- [ ] Create or add feature icons for AI Matching, Verified Profiles, and Secure Payments in client/public/ or client/src/assets/
- [ ] Update Home.jsx to use specific icons for each feature instead of generic ArrowRightIcon
- [ ] Add any background images or placeholders if needed for sections

## Update Registration Form
- [ ] Simplify Register.jsx: Reduce fields to essentials (email, password, confirmPassword, role, firstName, lastName, skills)
- [ ] Change Register.jsx to dark theme (bg-dark-900, etc.) to match Home page
- [ ] Make the form attractive and simple: Use consistent styling with Login.jsx

## Update Login Form
- [ ] Ensure Login.jsx matches the new Register.jsx style (dark theme, consistent layout)
- [ ] If needed, adjust layout to be similar but keep it simple for login

## Testing and Verification
- [ ] Test forms for functionality and responsiveness
- [ ] Verify images load correctly
- [ ] Run the app to ensure no errors
